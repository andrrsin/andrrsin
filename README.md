## Hola!
I'm a software engineer student who is currently studying in Universidad de Oviedo the last year. My interests are:
- Sports
- Gaming
- History
- Cultural exchange and socializing

I am from Gijón, Asturias, Spain this town is surrounded by football culture which has marked me during my whole life. It may be surprising but this passion encouraged me to study informatics. I loved reading data of every player and team making a younger self interested on bringing optimization to sports, dreaming one day I would be able to help Sporting to come back to Primera División.

## Experience
I have had some experience working in **ALISEC Soluciones S.L.** where I worked as a SOC level 1 analyst, checking many different businesses and public institutions. I loved the experience and I am glad I worked there as I obtained a wide knowledge on cybersecurity. However I discovered that being a SOC analyst wasn't my take on cybersecurity as I preferred pentesting. 

### ESN Spain and Oviedo
Something that marked my university life is the love to discover new people and help Erasmus students. I have been part of the local board of Erasmus Student Network Oviedo but my heart is moved by the fact that I am currently the webmaster of ESN Oviedo and I'm part of the IT team of ESN Spain, expanding my knowledge in system architecture and web development using CRMs
