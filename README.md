## Hola!
I'm a software engineer student who is currently studying in Universidad de Oviedo the last year. My interests are:
- Sports
- Gaming
- History
- Cultural exchange and socializing
I am from Gijón, Asturias, Spain this town is surrounded by football culture this has marked myself during my whole life. It may be surprising but this passion motivated me to study informatics I loved reading data of everything and when i was younger i was interested on bringing optimization to sports.

## Experience
I have had some experience working in ALISEC I worked as a SOC level 1 analyst. Checking many different businesses and public systems. I loved the experience I obtained but discovered that being a SOC analyst wasn't my take on cybersecurity I preferred pentesting. 

### ESN Spain and Oviedo
Something that marked my university life is the love to discover new people and help Erasmus students. I have been part of the local board of Erasmus Student Network Oviedo but even more important is the fact that I am currently the webmaster of ESN Oviedo and I'm part of the IT team of ESN Spain, expanding my knowledge in system architecture and web development using CRMs
